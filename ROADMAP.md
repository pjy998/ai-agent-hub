# AI Agent Hub Roadmap

## üéØ Version 0.0.9 (Current - Enhanced MVP)

**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

### Core Features
- [x] VS Code extension with Chat Participants (ai-agent.coding, ai-agent.refactor, ai-agent.requirements)
- [x] MCP Server with YAML preset loading and execution
- [x] Three core presets: coding-with-ai, refactor, requirements-analysis
- [x] VS Code marketplace publishing pipeline
- [x] Cross-platform MCP server support
- [x] Chat functionality verification testing

### Architecture
- [x] VS Code Extension (packages/ai-agent/) - Chat integration with streaming
- [x] MCP Runtime (packages/ai-mcp/) - Workflow execution engine
- [x] YAML Preset System (agents/presets/) - Workflow definitions
- [x] Automated build and testing pipeline

### Current Limitations (Analysis-Based)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Context Collector: Simple file concatenation, no relevance scoring
- ‚ö†Ô∏è MCP Server: Mock AI responses, no real model integration
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Tools System: No real file operation capabilities
- ‚ö†Ô∏è UI Feedback: Missing execution status display
