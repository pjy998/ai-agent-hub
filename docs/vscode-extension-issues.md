# VS Code Extension Issues Analysis and Solutions

## Issue Analysis

### Problem Summary
The AI Agent VS Code extension (`jieky.ai-agent-vscode-0.0.3`) is failing to activate due to a missing module dependency.

### Error Details
```
Error: Cannot find module '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index'
```

### Root Cause Analysis

**CONFIRMED ISSUE**: After examining the source code, I found the exact problem:

1. **Incorrect Import Path**: In `packages/ai-agent/src/extension.ts` line 2, the import statement is:
   ```typescript
   import { Client } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index';
   ```
   This path `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index` is incorrect.

2. **Dependency Present**: The `package.json` shows the dependency is correctly installed:
   ```json
   "dependencies": {
     "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk": "^1.17.3"
   }
   ```

3. **Wrong Module Path**: The MCP SDK v1.17.3 doesn't export from `/client/index` path. The correct import should be from the main package or a different subpath.

## Current Extension Structure

Based on the project structure, the extension is located at:
- Source: `packages/ai-agent/src/extension.ts`
- Package: `packages/ai-agent/package.json`
- Built Extension: `packages/ai-agent/ai-agent-vscode-0.0.3.vsix`

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Fix Dependencies in package.json

The extension's `package.json` needs to include the MCP SDK as a dependency:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```

### Solution 2: Update Import Statement

Check and fix the import statement in `extension.ts`:

```typescript
// Instead of:
import { ... } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index';

// Use:
import { ... } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client';
// or
import { ... } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk';
```

### Solution 3: Bundle Dependencies Properly

Ensure the extension build process includes all dependencies:

1. Install dependencies in the extension directory
2. Use a bundler (webpack/esbuild) to include dependencies
3. Update the build script to bundle the MCP SDK

### Solution 4: Use Local MCP Implementation

Since the project has its own MCP implementation in `packages/ai-mcp/`, consider:

1. Import from the local MCP package
2. Update the import path to reference the local implementation
3. Ensure the local MCP package is properly built and available

## Immediate Fix Steps

### Step 1: Check Current Dependencies
```bash
cd packages/ai-agent
npm list
```

### Step 2: Install Missing Dependencies
```bash
cd packages/ai-agent
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
```

### Step 3: Rebuild Extension
```bash
cd packages/ai-agent
npm run compile
vsce package
```

### Step 4: Test Extension
Install the newly built extension and verify it activates without errors.

## Prevention Measures

1. **Dependency Audit**: Regularly check that all imported modules are listed in dependencies
2. **Build Validation**: Add build steps that verify all dependencies are available
3. **Testing**: Test extension activation in a clean VS Code environment
4. **CI/CD**: Implement automated testing for extension packaging and activation

## Related Files to Check

1. `packages/ai-agent/src/extension.ts` - Main extension file with the problematic import
2. `packages/ai-agent/package.json` - Extension dependencies and configuration
3. `packages/ai-agent/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
4. `packages/ai-mcp/` - Local MCP implementation that might be used instead

## Status

- **Issue Identified**: ✅ Missing MCP SDK dependency
- **Root Cause**: ✅ Import statement references unavailable module
- **Solution Proposed**: ✅ Multiple approaches documented
- **Fix Applied**: ❌ Pending implementation
- **Testing**: ❌ Pending fix application

## Next Actions

1. Examine the current extension source code
2. Determine the correct MCP SDK dependency
3. Update package.json with proper dependencies
4. Rebuild and test the extension
5. Update the extension version and redistribute
